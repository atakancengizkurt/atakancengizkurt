Atakan Cengiz KURT


HelloðŸ‘‹, I am Atakan Cengiz KURT who as an iOS Developer works at Loodos for Vodafone. Since 2017, I have been coding iOS with high passion without shutting down my MacBook during a month. In GitHub, I am trying to share open-source frameworks that might help to improve my reputation. Because sharing is good, I am publishing articles on my Blog. Besides  I am glad to help new iOS developers.
